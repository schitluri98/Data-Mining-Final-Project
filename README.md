**Objective :**

In the modern days, with the increase in the number of technologies and number of research being conducted in each field, it becomes difficult in finding the research paper 
most relevant to paper of our interest. Since a lot of research papers are being published in the current time, it also becomes increasing difficult to validate the authenticity
of the research papers published. For further performing in-depth research on a particular topic, it becomes essential to track and study the research papers that has cited and 
has been cited by the research paper in hands. The main aim of this project is to build a hybrid content and collaborative based recommendation system that recommends the best 
suitable research paper to the researchers based on popularity metrics, content similarity and the collaborative nature of citations and references. The system implemented is 
also deployed in local host to facilitate user interface that could be used by the visitors to find relevant research paper easily. The system is also evaluated by comparing its
performance with the recommender system of the webpage from which the data scraped and is found to be performing much more efficiently than the existing recommender system.
